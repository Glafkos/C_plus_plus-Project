# C_plus_plus-Project
This project was implemented during the module of C++ programming language during the 3rd semester of my course.

The purpose of this project was to carry out the simulation of robotics cars in order of them to
explore a planet and also help in the mining of useful resources. These robotics cars are different kinds 
of cars (explorer, rescuer and analyst), which move in a specific spot, where it consists the simulation map.

The program is compile with the default settings and the compiler of Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012.
